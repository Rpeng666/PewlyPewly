## 🛡️ Fuck Recommendation (Save My Attention)

> **Your attention is being plundered.**
>
> In today's internet environment, major platforms are doing their best to compete for your attention. Recommendation algorithms, infinite scrolling, red dot notifications... these carefully designed mechanisms have only one purpose: to keep you on the platform longer and sell more ads.
>
> If you find yourself mindlessly scrolling through videos and wasting a lot of time, **please don't blame yourself**. It's not that you lack self-control, but that you are fighting against a huge team of top psychologists, data scientists, and engineers. Their goal is to break through your psychological defenses and use dopamine loops to get you addicted, while you are just an unarmed user.

To help you regain control of your attention, we have added the **Fuck Recommendation** mode based on the original BewlyBewly.

After enabling this mode, you can:
- **Simple Mode**: Hide all recommended videos on the homepage, giving you a fresh start.
- **Hide Comments**: Out of sight, out of mind. Avoid getting involved in meaningless arguments and emotional drain.
- **Only Show Followed**: Only see content you actively choose to follow, refusing "junk food" fed by algorithms.
- **Hide Video Recommendations**: The recommendation list on the right side of the playback page? Make it disappear and focus on the current video.
- **Hide Ending Recommendations**: Video finished? Then it ends. Don't tempt me to click on the next one.
- **Disable Preview Images**: Hide the video player preview image to reduce visual distraction.

We hope that through these features, we can help you break free from the coercion of algorithms and become the master of yourself again.

## ⚡ Playback Enhancements

- **Extended Playback Speeds**: Added 3.0x, 4.0x, and 5.0x playback speed options to the player, helping you breeze through long videos.
