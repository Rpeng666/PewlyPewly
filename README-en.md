## 🛡️ Reclaim My Attention (Fuck Recommendation)

> Your attention is being exploited
> 
> In today’s internet ecosystem, major platforms are engaged in an all-out war for > your attention.
> Recommendation algorithms, infinite scrolling, red-dot notifications—these > mechanisms are carefully engineered with a single goal:

Keep you staying longer, so more ads can be sold.

If you often find yourself mindlessly scrolling through videos and wasting hours of time, do not blame yourself.

This is not a lack of self-control.

You are fighting against an entire industry—teams of top psychologists, data scientists, and engineers—whose sole purpose is to break your mental defenses, hijack your dopamine feedback loop, and keep you addicted.

You are just one unarmed user.

To help you take back control of your attention, we introduce Fuck Recommendation (Reclaim My Attention) mode, built on top of the original BewlyBewly.

When this mode is enabled, you can:

Minimal Home Mode
Hide all recommended videos on the homepage and start with a clean slate.

Hide Comments Section
Out of sight, out of mind. Avoid meaningless arguments and emotional drain.

Show Following Only
Watch only the content you explicitly chose to follow. No more algorithmic junk food.

Hide Side Recommendations
Remove the recommended video list on the right side of the player and focus on the current video.

Disable End-Screen Recommendations
The video ends—and so does your watching. No more temptation to click the next one.

Disable Video Preview Thumbnails
Hide preview thumbnails in the video player to reduce visual distraction.

Our goal is simple:
Free you from algorithmic manipulation and help you become the owner of your own attention again.

## ⚡ Playback Enhancements

Extended Playback Speed Options
Adds 3.0x, 4.0x, and 5.0x speed options to the video player, making it easier to skim long videos efficiently.
